# IITB-CPU

## How to run
- Open `CPU.vhdl`, `Memory.vhdl`, `ALU.vhdl`, `Reg_File.vhdl`, `Reg16BIT.vhdl`, `MUX_2.vhdl`, `MUX_4.vhdl`, `MUX_8.vhdl` and `tb_CPU.vhdl` in Quartus
- The memory entity `Memory.vhd` has been hard-coded for testing all instructions, however it can be customized.
- Compile with `CPU.vhd` as top-level entity
